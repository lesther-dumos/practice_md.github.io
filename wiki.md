## ACL Purpose
The **anterior cruciate ligament(ACL)** is a connective tissue located in the knee, between the femur and tibia. Itâ€™s an important ligament that assists the body with internal rotational as well as valgus angulation. Movements that consist of cutting and pivoting are important as the ACL is required for the stability of the knee. 

## ACL Tears

Approximately there are 100,000 to 200,000 ACL ruptures annually in the US with women having 2 to 8 times more likely to occur. This is due to women often having significantly less muscle mass in the knee, as well having more flexion- instability to the knee.

An ACL occurs when the tibia goes one direction and the femur goes another. Which in turns ruptures the ACL, which often tends to the damaging of the meniscus as well. During an accident of the ACL, a *pop* or *snap* can be often felt and heard. Swelling of the knee follows after and the inability to bear weight on the injured leg. 

## Surgical Treatment of Knee
ACL tears can not heal by normal means due the ligament having no blood supply.  If the MRI evaluation of the knee suspects that the ACL is indeed torn or ruptured, ***surgical treatment is necessary for recovery***. There are two options for surgery:

1. ### Allograft

    - Option mainly consists of receiving a cadaver donor used for ACL reconstruction. Allografts give the advantage of having less postoperative pain and having to make less incisions on the knee. 
    
2. ### Autograft
    -  Patellar Tendon

        - Removes middle third of patellar tendon  and pieces of bones from shin and knee cap. Drills two holes above and below knee then inserts components from tendon and shin to replace ACL
        
    -  Hamstring Tendon
        - Removes a piece of hamstring tendon behind the thigh. Makes holes into the knee to be used as an ACL
        
    -  Quadriceps tendon
        - Removes middle third of quadriceps tendon and use it to replace ACL

## Recovery
It can be expected of a time frame of 9 -12 months for a full recovery of the knee. Oftentimes associated with surgery is having rehab through physical therapy that follows the doctor's protocol. In addition to the physical therapist ability to create workout plans that follows the patient's abilities in the perusement of full recovery.
